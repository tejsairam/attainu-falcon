To be honest, I've been programming since only 3 months. I did it because it was fun to create something from nothing.

It required problem solving techniques that are inherent to my being and therefore was really natural and simple.

It is an infinite toy as well as a skill and it's methodology can be used in everyday life to solve a myriad of problems.

It's limitless in it's possibilities, and it allows you a great deal of freedom(provided your working on your own stuff).

Everything is possible for you in digital form. Nothing escapes you provided time is not an issue.

You can create simple things like form processing to entire virtual universes just because you can or feel like it.

It's literally an extension of your mindâ€¦ not something to be taken up as a career if you don't love it. But I think everyone should learn some type of programming language if only to learn the logic behind it. It Truly is an art form.
